# 🏷️ Retail Sales Performance Dashboard (Power BI)

### 📊 Project Overview
This project analyzes the sales data of a **retail shop** across multiple regions to understand how **discounts, pricing, and product mix** affect overall sales and profitability.  
The dataset includes transactions segmented by **region, product category, and discount percentage**.

Using **Power BI**, I developed an interactive dashboard that visualizes key KPIs — total sales, total units sold, and profit distribution — across products and regions.

---

### 🎯 Objectives
- Evaluate the **impact of discounts** on total sales performance across regions.  
- Identify which regions and products drive the **highest revenue**.  
- Compare **average prices and discounts** across different geographical markets.  
- Provide actionable recommendations for improving underperforming regions.

### 🧠 Key Findings

1. 🟩 **East Region: Highest Sales**
   - The **East region recorded the highest total sales (₹218K)**.
   - It also had the **highest average discount (10.29%)**, which clearly boosted customer purchases.
   - Discounting proved highly effective here, indicating **price-sensitive customers** who respond well to promotions.

2. 🟦 **South Region: Second-Highest Sales with Lowest Discount**
   - The **South region** achieved **₹202K in total sales**, despite having the **lowest discount rate (9.38%)**.
   - The reason is a **different product mix** — this region sells **premium, high-end electronic items** such as the **Galaxy S23 Ultra and LG OLED TVs**, which generate large revenue even at lower discount levels.
   - This shows that **product type** plays as significant a role as discounting.

3. 🟧 **West and North Regions: Lagging Performance**
   - The **West (₹177K)** and **North (₹172K)** regions lag behind in total sales.
   - Possible causes:
     - **Lower marketing penetration** or weaker distribution networks.
     - **Limited stock or product variety**, especially in high-end categories.
     - Discounts (9.67% in North, 10.06% in West) were moderate but **not paired with demand-generating campaigns**.
     - **Customer demographics** in these areas may have lower purchasing power or higher price sensitivity.
   - These regions could benefit from **targeted promotions and better assortment planning**.
